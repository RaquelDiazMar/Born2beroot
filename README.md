# Born2beroot
From **[42Madrid](https://www.42madrid.com/) Cursus**, this repository goes around a __System Administration__ related exercise.

> Always remember that you are absolutely unique. Just as everyone else.

## Mandatory Part 
### VirtualBox Installation
For this part, just refer to [Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and follow the instructions after downloading the virtualization product.
> Notice that @[42Madrid](https://www.42madrid.com/), there are space constraints related to this preliminary process. Then, most likely, installation through `storage/goinfre/intra_name` might be the best solution even though later on the work performed is bound to that iMac.  
> It shall be advisable to update the folder permissions: `sudo chmod 777 born2beroot_folder/` 

### Debian Installation
Let's go step by step for this part (if in doubt, refer to cursus project subject.pdf):
1. Download [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)
2. Open your previously installed VirtualBox:  
    2.1. asjhdf  
    2.2.
3. asdf
4. sdf
